Fill Tool By YOU-G

Our smart auto-fill tool is designed to make frame-by-frame animation coloring faster and easier. Instead of manually filling every region on every frame, you can automate the entire process with just a few clicks while keeping colors consistent and accurate.

How It Works

Step 1: Import Your Frames
Load your lineart frames into the tool. It supports multiple frames, so you can work on your entire project at once.

Step 2: Place Markers
Mark the regions you want to color on one frame. These markers help the tool identify the exact areas that need filling.

Step 3: Choose Colors
Select the desired color for each marked region. The tool remembers your choices to maintain color consistency across all frames.

Step 4: Click Fill
With a single click, the tool automatically applies the selected colors to all marked regions across every frame instantly.

Step 5: Preview and Export
Quickly preview your colored animation and export the frames in your preferred format.
